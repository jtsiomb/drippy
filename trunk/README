drippy 0.1 - datafile ripper
by John Tsiombikas <nuclear@member.fsf.org>

This little tool searches through any unknown archive or data pack, and extracts
all files that it recognizes from it.

The only restriction is that files inside the archive must not be broken into
pieces, scrambled or encrypted in any way, otherwise there's no way to recognize
and extract them without knowledge of the archive format.

Drip is free software, and you may freely use, modify and redistribute it under
